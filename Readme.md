# RUQE
Rust Quantum Emulator. The idea is to build a crate in rust which easily simulates quantum systems, given their Hamiltonian or Lindbladian.

Right now I'm working on adding basic support for operators, and being able to construct a general static Hamiltonian.
The next step will probably involve adding transformations from quantum information.

Someday there might even be support for solving the Schrodinger equation.

Calling this a work in progress is an exaggeration. I'm using this to learn Rust, while building something I'll enjoy using.
If anything here helps you, feel free to use it.
