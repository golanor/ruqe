# RUQE
Rust Quantum Emulator. The idea is to build a crate in rust which easily simulated quantum systems, given their Hamiltonian or Lindbladian.

## TODO
[x] Add Pauli matrices.

[x] Setup git.

[x] Find a way to define a generic n-qubit operator with a static matrix.

[] Define a hamiltonian.

[] Calculate time evolution of a state given a Hamiltonian.

[] Add plotting capabilities.

[] Add support for density matrices and superoperators.

[] Add support for a time dependent hamiltonian - add ODE solving support.

[] Add support for a state vector simulation?
